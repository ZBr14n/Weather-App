# What is this?

This is a basic weather app that displays current weather condition in Boston, computes the average temperature pulled from multiple weather API sources, and upload/retrieve to/from the database. The app uses a full-stack template of Next.js, GraphQL, and PostGreSQL. This app is intended to be an experimentation of new technologies, so the tools used here might just be overkill for a simple app. 

# My Thoughts/Goal

I remmeber investing a lot of time reading the documentation for graphql queries, mutations, and subscriptions, and then having to integrate this to the Server-side Next.js framework. I feel like I am only scratching the surface of what these technologies can do, so this weather app here still needs improvement. I'm always trying to look for ways to make sense out of all of this, particular the use of a graphql and database here; the app just needs to be more thought out. 

One idea that I have in mind to enhance the app is to create a function where every day, the app automatically records the average temperature into the database. Over the course of a week, the app will use data visualization library to map the average data.
